We'll assume we have three agents (Agent A, Agent B, and Agent C) in the network, 
and we'll follow their interactions and workflows as they collaborate on a task.

Initial State:

The network is initialized, and all agents are registered with their capabilities.
Agent A is the initial SuperAgent, and Agent B is its backup.
There is a pending task in the task queue: "Analyze data and generate a report."

Step 1: Task Delegation (SuperAgent: Agent A)

Prompt: "You are the current SuperAgent. A new task 'Analyze data and generate a report' has been added to the queue. Evaluate the task requirements and delegate it to capable peers."
Information Given: Task details, peer registry with agent capabilities.
Expected from Agent: Delegation plan, including which peers to assign the task to and any sub-tasks.
Options for Next Step: Propose delegation plan, request more information, or re-evaluate the task.
Agent A evaluates the task and proposes the following delegation plan:

Sub-task 1 (Data Preparation): Assign to Agent B
Sub-task 2 (Data Analysis): Assign to Agent C
Sub-task 3 (Report Generation): Assign to Agent A



Step 2: Consensus Phase (SuperAgent: Agent A)

Prompt: "You have proposed the following delegation plan: [delegation plan details]. Initiate the consensus protocol to get approval from the peers."
Information Given: Delegation plan, peer list.
Expected from Agent: Initiate consensus protocol, collect votes from peers.
Options for Next Step: Proceed with consensus, re-evaluate delegation plan, or abort.
Agent A initiates the consensus protocol (e.g., using HotStuff) by sending the delegation plan to all peers and collecting their votes.

Step 3: Consensus Voting (Peer: Agent B)

Prompt: "You have received a delegation plan from the SuperAgent: [delegation plan details]. Review the plan and cast your vote."
Information Given: Delegation plan, own capabilities.
Expected from Agent: Vote (YES or NO) on the delegation plan.
Options for Next Step: Vote YES, Vote NO, or request more information.
Agent B reviews the plan, finds Sub-task 1 (Data Preparation) within its capabilities, and votes YES.

Step 4: Consensus Voting (Peer: Agent C)

Prompt: "You have received a delegation plan from the SuperAgent: [delegation plan details]. Review the plan and cast your vote."
Information Given: Delegation plan, own capabilities.
Expected from Agent: Vote (YES or NO) on the delegation plan.
Options for Next Step: Vote YES, Vote NO, or request more information.
Agent C reviews the plan, finds Sub-task 2 (Data Analysis) within its capabilities, and votes YES.

Step 5: Consensus Result (SuperAgent: Agent A)

Prompt: "You have received votes from the peers. Evaluate the consensus result."
Information Given: Peer votes, delegation plan.
Expected from Agent: Determine if consensus is achieved, and either commit the delegation plan or re-evaluate.
Options for Next Step: Commit delegation plan, re-evaluate delegation plan, or abort.
Agent A sees that a quorum of YES votes has been achieved and commits the delegation plan.

Step 6: Task Execution (Peer: Agent B)

Prompt: "You have been assigned Sub-task 1 (Data Preparation) as part of the committed delegation plan. Execute the sub-task."
Information Given: Sub-task details, data sources.
Expected from Agent: Perform the data preparation steps and update status.
Options for Next Step: Continue execution, request assistance, or report completion.
Agent B performs the data preparation steps and updates the status in the shared state.

Step 7: Task Execution (Peer: Agent C)

Prompt: "You have been assigned Sub-task 2 (Data Analysis) as part of the committed delegation plan. Execute the sub-task."
Information Given: Sub-task details, prepared data from Agent B.
Expected from Agent: Perform the data analysis steps and update status.
Options for Next Step: Continue execution, request assistance, or report completion.
Agent C performs the data analysis steps using the prepared data and updates the status.

Step 8: Task Execution (SuperAgent: Agent A)

Prompt: "You have been assigned Sub-task 3 (Report Generation) as part of the committed delegation plan. Execute the sub-task."
Information Given: Sub-task details, analyzed data from Agent C.
Expected from Agent: Generate the report and update status.
Options for Next Step: Continue execution, request assistance, or report completion.
Agent A generates the final report using the analyzed data and updates the status as completed.

Step 9: Task Completion (SuperAgent: Agent A)

Prompt: "All sub-tasks for the 'Analyze data and generate a report' task have been completed. Finalize the task and update the shared state."
Information Given: Task details, sub-task statuses, final report.
Expected from Agent: Update the task status as completed and share the final report.
Options for Next Step: Complete the task or request additional actions.
Agent A marks the task as completed in the shared state and shares the final report with the other agents.
