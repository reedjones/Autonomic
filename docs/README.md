# P2P agent network with multiple peers involved.

Here's a TODO list for a super simple demo to prove the viability of our P2P agent network:

1. **Set up the project structure**
    - [ ]  Create the directory structure as per the suggested scaffolding
    - [ ]  Initialize the Python package and modules
    - [ ]  Set up virtual environment and install required dependencies
2. **Implement core services**
    - [ ]  Create a simple in-memory `task_queue` service
    - [ ]  Implement the `agent_registry` service to store agent information
    - [ ]  Create a basic `peer_communication` service for agent messaging
3. **Define agent base class**
    - [ ]  Create the `agent_base` class with common functionality
    - [ ]  Implement the `run_agent` function for executing agents
    - [ ]  Add the `next_step` function for control flow management
4. **Implement agent types**
    - [ ]  Create a `super_agent` class inheriting from `agent_base`
    - [ ]  Implement task delegation and consensus initiation for the `super_agent`
    - [ ]  Create a `worker_agent` class inheriting from `agent_base`
    - [ ]  Implement task execution and consensus voting for the `worker_agent`
5. **Set up simulated P2P network**
    - [ ]  Create a simple in-memory data structure to simulate the P2P network
    - [ ]  Implement functions for agents to read and write to the shared state
6. **Define prompts and control flow**
    - [ ]  Create the initial prompt for the `super_agent`
    - [ ]  Define prompts for task delegation, consensus, and task execution
    - [ ]  Implement the `parse_response_and_get_next_step` function
7. **Write tests**
    - [ ]  Create unit tests for individual services and agent functions
    - [ ]  Write integration tests for task delegation and execution workflows
8. **Set up the main entry point**
    - [ ]  Create the `main.py` file as the entry point for running the demo
    - [ ]  Implement the main function to initialize agents and services
    - [ ]  Run the demo workflow and print or log the output
9. **Add logging and monitoring**
    - [ ]  Set up a basic logging system for agents and services
    - [ ]  Implement simple monitoring for agent status and task progress
10. **Documentation and cleanup**
    - [ ]  Update the `README.md` file with project description and instructions
    - [ ]  Document the code with docstrings and comments
    - [ ]  Clean up and refactor the code as needed

agents/: This directory contains the codebase for the agent implementations, 
including the base agent class, utility functions, and subclasses for different types of agents 
(e.g., super agent, worker agent).

consensus/: This directory contains the implementation of consensus protocols, 
such as HotStuff, used by the agents for distributed decision-making.

services/: This directory contains the implementation of various services required by the agents, 
such as task queue, agent registry, peer communication, shared state storage, consensus service, and delegation service.

execution/: This directory contains the code for executing tasks or sub-tasks assigned to agents, 
including an execution manager and specific task executors (e.g., data analysis, report generation).

utils/: This directory contains utility functions and modules, such as configuration management, 
logging, and other shared utilities.

tests/: This directory contains unit tests and integration 
tests for the various components of the system.

docs/: This directory contains documentation files, such as README.md, for the project.

requirements.txt: This file lists the project's Python package dependencies.

main.py: This is the main entry point for running the P2P agent network.
