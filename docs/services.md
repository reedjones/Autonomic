table of the services that each agent might have/need access to:

| Service | Mandatory/Optional | Use/Functionality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task Queue | Mandatory | To submit, claim, and update the status of tasks. |
| Agent Registry | Mandatory | To register themselves and discover other agents in the network. |
| Peer Communication | Mandatory | To send and receive messages from other agents for coordination. |
| Shared State Storage | Mandatory | To read and update the shared state of the network (e.g., task statuses, delegation plans). |
| Consensus Service | Mandatory | To initiate and participate in consensus protocols (e.g., HotStuff) for distributed decision-making. |
| Delegation Service | Mandatory | For the SuperAgent to propose and manage delegation plans for tasks. |
| Execution Environment | Mandatory | To execute tasks or sub-tasks assigned to them (e.g., data analysis, report generation). |
| Resource Monitoring | Optional | To monitor and report their resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory, disk) for efficient task allocation. |
| Logging and Monitoring | Optional | To log their activities and provide monitoring data for debugging and performance analysis. |
| External Data Access | Optional | To access external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs) required for task execution. |
| Model Management | Optional | To access and utilize pre-trained models or facilitate model training as part of task execution. |
| Scheduling Service | Optional | To schedule and manage their duty cycles (e.g., wake-up, sleep, task execution times). |
| Failure Detection | Optional | To detect and report failures of other agents or components in the network. |
| Security Services | Optional | For authentication, authorization, and encryption of communications within the network. |
| Load Balancing | Optional | To distribute tasks across agents based on their resource availability and workload. |
| Workflow Management | Optional | To define and manage complex workflows involving multiple tasks and dependencies. |
