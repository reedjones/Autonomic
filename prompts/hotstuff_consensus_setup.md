To initialize the HotStuff consensus protocol for super agent election:

1. All peers in the network must be assigned a unique ID and public/private key pair.
2. One of the initial peers will act as the boot leader and generate the initial genesis block.
3. The genesis block will contain the boot leader's ID, the current blockchain height (0), and a state summarizing the initial configuration (e.g. current super agent, peers in the network, etc.)
4. The boot leader sends the genesis block to all peers, who will verify and add it to their local blockchain copy.
5. You are now ready to enter the HotStuff consensus view for super agent election.
