Peers can fail or depart unexpectedly. To handle failures:

1. Each peer sends periodic heartbeats to the SuperAgent.
2. If the SuperAgent detects a missed heartbeat, it marks the peer as FAILED.
3. Any tasks assigned to the failed peer are re-assigned using consensus.
4. If the SuperAgent itself fails, the Backup takes over based on SUPER_ELECTED msgs.
5. If both SuperAgent and Backup fail, re-initiate the SuperAgent Election protocol.
