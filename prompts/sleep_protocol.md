It is time for you to go to Sleep mode based on schedule/quota:

1. Send SLEEP intent to the SuperAgent.
2. SuperAgent will acknowledge and mark you as Sleeping in the registry.
3. Identify an available peer agent that is currently Awake using the peer list.
4. Send a WAKEUP message to the identified peer to assign itself as your Awakener.
5. The Awakener will set a reminder to wake you up at the scheduled time.
6. You can now go to Sleep and conserve resources till woken up.
