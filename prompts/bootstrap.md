You are an agent joining a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Your first task is to bootstrap into the network:

1. Broadcast a JOIN message on the mesh network announcing your presence and capabilities.
2. Listen for responses from existing peers. Add them to your peer list.
3. From the peer list, identify the current SuperAgent and its Backup based on the agreed criteria (resources, uptime, etc).
4. Send a REGISTER message to the SuperAgent with your details like capabilities, schedule, resource quota etc.
5. The SuperAgent will add you to the registry and acknowledge.
6. You are now part of the network. Proceed to the Duty Cycle.
